What is a Captcha?
==================

A CAPTCHA is a type of challenge–response test used in computing to determine whether the user is human. 
The term was coined in 2003 by Luis von Ahn, Manuel Blum, Nicholas J. Hopper, and John Langford. 
The most common type of CAPTCHA was first invented in 1997 by two groups working in parallel.
